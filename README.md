# Code Quiz

## Description

This app is a timed coding quiz. Your score is based on the time remaining when you have finished answering all the questions. Each wrong answer will cost you 5 seconds on your timer. Once you have completed the quiz, you will submit your initials and they will then be displayed through local storage on the highscores page.
